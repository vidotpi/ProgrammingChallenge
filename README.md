#recently i found a book called "Programming challenges" by steven skiena that has a lot of
programming problems, most of them are easy and some of them are challenging so i read some 
of them and tried to solve one of them in paper, that was interesting and i decided to code all 
problems in my hobby times and put them in github so other programmer could see it. i'm not claim that i solved
the problems in best way!!! of course maybe there is a better way to solve a problem.
